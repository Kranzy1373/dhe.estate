# Hunter versus Vampire - Which is Better?

<small>*The centuries old question.*</small>

### Being A Hunter:

Hunters are technologically advanced, they have exclusive weapons and armor,
skillfully camouflage in the open, and hunt down those evil Vampires.

{{< p/indent 10 >}}
<b>Pros</b>:
<br>
The benefits of being a Hunter is the exclusivity of items unlocked such as
semi-automatic crossbows and Holy Water. Being a Hunter provides immunity
against Vampiris Sanguinare which converts Humans to Vampires after an amount
of time being effected.
<br>
PvPers will enjoy the array of combative bonuses, such as passively increased
attack damage.

{{< p/indent 10 >}}
<b>Cons</b>:
<br>
The drawback of being a Hunter is the arguably higher difficulty and cost for
leveling compared to Vampires. Hunters will need to seek a living Trainer NPC
which are found in specific villages under certain conditions, and do not
respawn after death. While Vampires may reuse materials for leveling up,
Hunters must permanently pay Trainers NPCs to do the same.
<br>
Hunters who do not wish to compete within combat will find much less offerings
than if they were to become a Vampire.

<b>Summary</b>:
<br>
Hunters are specialized in hunting Vampires thus having combat-focused skills.
It is noteworthy that Vampires have a skill branch focused on combat, but
nearly every Hunters skill is focused on combat. Hunters are essentially the
improved form of a Human given that Hunters all the traits of humanity with
only additional benefits.

### Being A Vampire:

Vampires are magical creatures who reign at night, using their magic to give
themselves an edge, and spread their dark gift of Vampiris Sanguinare to
Humans.

{{< p/indent 10 >}}
<b>Pros</b>:
<br>
Vampires can turn into bats and fly, have passively increased speed with each
levelup, ignored by fellow Vampires and Undead Zombies immediately and Creepers
additionally with a skill, can teleport, gain strength from rage, and much more
including a combat-skill branch, self sufficiency skills, and other generalized
skills.
<br>
Vampire's Hunger Bar is replaced with a Blood Bar for blood consumption. An
iconic benefit of being a Vampire is the ability to consume Human Hearts which
restores a full Blood Bar. For ever few levelups Vampires gain addition
consumption capacity with 2 full Blood Bars being the highest achieved
capacity.

{{< p/indent 10 >}}
<b>Cons</b>:
<br>
Vampires cannot bear the Sunlight, highly vulnerable to fire, and gain weakness
from water contact without skilled immunity. This together makes daytime
activities and Nether exploration highly difficult. Vampires may die from night
time exploration as a bat when encountering Hunter NPCs bearing a crossbow.
Vampires visiting a Neutral village that drink too much blood from Villagers
may cause Villager NPCs revolt and kill the Vampires.
<br>
While Vampires can indeed consume Human Hearts, Vampire's diet is not very
adaptable to new environment, relying upon blood-giving creatures to survive
whereas Humans and Hunters can easily transport materials to make a quick
vegetation farm. Vampires can pack Human Hearts and filled Blood Containers
to address this con.

{{< p/indent 10 >}}
<b>Summary</b>:
<br>
Vampires are generalized, offering a variety of possibilities that can be used
in numerous ways. Since Vampires are magical creatures most skills are always
available and ready for use, unlike the Hunter who must gain the skill and
materially prepare.

### Conclusion: Which is Better?

There's no definitive better when becoming a Hunter or Vampire. Which major
faction to join depends on whatever suits you best. Are you combat focused?
Become a Hunter. Prefer generality? Become a Vampire. Try experimenting with
both factions to see what you like, you can always change later.
